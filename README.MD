## Features
- Encrypt and decrypt keys using AES-256 encryption.
- Store keys securely in a combined file with restricted permissions.
- Upload encrypted keys to Google Drive with progress tracking.
- Download encrypted keys from Google Drive.
- Convert hexadecimal values to a combined key format.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Required packages:
  - `google-api-python-client`
  - `google-auth`
  - `cryptography`
  - `bcrypt`
  - `rich`

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install google-api-python-client google-auth cryptography bcrypt rich
```

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/google-drive-key-manager.git
   cd google-drive-key-manager
   ```

2. Create a Google Cloud project and enable the Google Drive API.
3. Download your service account credentials as a JSON file and save it as `client_secrets.json` in the project directory.

## Usage
1. Run the module:

   ```bash
   python your_module.py
   ```

2. Follow the prompts to:
   - Encrypt a new key
   - Decrypt an existing key
   - Convert hexadecimal values to a combined key format

### Example Usage
- To encrypt a key:
   - Choose the option to encrypt a key.
   - Enter your private key and a secure password.
   - The combined key file will be created and uploaded to your specified Google Drive folder.

- To decrypt a key:
   - Choose the option to decrypt a key.
   - Provide the Google Drive file ID of the encrypted key.
   - Enter the password to decrypt and retrieve your original key.

- To convert hexadecimal values to a combined key:
   - Choose the option to convert hex values.
   - Input the required hexadecimal values for AES key, nonce, tag, and salt.

## Functions
### `authenticate_drive()`
Authenticates and builds the Google Drive API service.

### `derive_key(password: str, salt: bytes) -> bytes`
Derives a secure key from a given password using bcrypt.

### `create_combined_key_file(file_name: str, combined_key: bytes)`
Creates a combined key file with secure permissions.

### `encrypt_key(key: str, password: str) -> bytes`
Encrypts a provided key using AES-256 encryption.

### `decrypt_key(combined_key: bytes, password: str) -> str`
Decrypts an encrypted key.

### `convert_hex_to_combined_key(hex_aes_key: str, hex_nonce: str, hex_tag: str, hex_salt: str) -> bytes`
Converts hexadecimal values into a combined key format.

### `upload_to_drive(file_name: str, content: bytes, folder_id: str = None)`
Uploads a file to Google Drive with progress tracking.

### `download_from_drive(file_id: str, file_name: str)`
Downloads a file from Google Drive.
